# eventstreams-samples/java-apache/01-kafka-intro

This directory contains samples written in java, using the Apache Kafka clients.
These samples do _not_ follow Kafka and Event Streams best practices
and should _not_ be used to create applications.
They are intended for newcomers to experiment with Kafka and see how producers and consumers operate.
See the [producer](./producer/README.md) and [consumer](./consumer/README.md) READMEs for instructions on building and running the applications.

## Examples

The examples demonstrate some of the behavior of Kafka using the producer and consumer in this directory.
These examples are not intended to explain Kafka in detail.

Examples using a topic with one partition are [here](./OnePartition.md).

Examples using a topic with multiple partitions are [here](./TwoPartition.md).
