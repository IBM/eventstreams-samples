# eventstreams-samples

[IBM Event Streams for IBM Cloud](https://www.ibm.com/uk-en/cloud/event-streams)
is a scalable, distributed, high throughput message bus built on Apache Kafka.
You can use Event Streams to unite your on-premise and off-premise cloud
technologies. You can wire micro-services together using open protocols,
connect stream data to analytics to realize powerful insight and feed event
data to multiple applications to react in real time.

This repository is for samples which interact with the Event Streams service.
Information and instructions regarding the use of these samples can be found in
their respective directories.

## About this Repository

The samples in this repository are provided under the [Apache license](./LICENSE).

The contents of this repository are created and maintained by the Event Streams team at IBM.
To submit requests for additional samples or to report bugs or other problems,
please create an issue using the "New issue" button.

New releases will be published at intervals.
Please check the [changelog](./CHANGELOG.md) for content of releases.

These samples are the newer version using Java. There are older samples using other languages and clients available [here](https://github.com/ibm-messaging/event-streams-samples). Please note that these samples are not monitored and will be deprecated soon. 

## Aim of the Samples

These samples are designed to help you get started with Event Streams for IBM
Cloud within minutes. They are not production-ready applications but should
give you useful pointers on how to write reliable Kafka applications that work
well with Event Streams.

## Samples

- The [java-apache](./java-apache/README.md) directory has samples written in Java using the Apache Kafka client libraries.
- Examples for other languages and client libraries will be added. Please create an issue if there is a specific language and library you would like to see included.

## Running the Samples

Each sample directory has instructions for building and running the sample.

You will need an Event Streams instance to run samples.
See the [instructions](./Instructions.md) for creating a service instance and credentials for access.
